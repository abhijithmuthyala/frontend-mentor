                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

              &ldquo; I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
              I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people
              who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course, O've successfully switched
              careeres, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. &rdquo;

              &ldquo; Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of
              code. I needed structure from professionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
              program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
              were hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.The
              agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
              learning to a next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
              have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
              example of my developer experience. It certainly helped me land a
              job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend! &rdquo;
